## üìã Initial Feature Specification

### Core Requirements
Build a CRUD application for managing monkeys with the following specifications:

**Data Model:**
- `monkey_id`: UUID string (primary key)

## üó£Ô∏è Key AI Prompts (Exact Text)

### 1. Project Bootstrap Prompt
```
Build a super basic CRUD app that manages Monkeys using AI/codegen tools effectively.

Core Requirements:
1. Frontend: React with modern UI
2. Data Model: monkey_id (UUID), name (2-40 chars), species (enum: capuchin, macaque, marmoset, howler), age_years (0-45), favourite_fruit, last_checkup_at (optional ISO datetime)
3. Validation: Name required; no duplicates within same species; Age 0-45; If species = marmoset, age_years ‚â§ 22
4. Backend: FastAPI with DynamoDB storage (credentials provided)
5. Testing: Comprehensive automated testing

Use modern React with Shadcn components for professional appearance. Implement full CRUD operations with search functionality.
```

### 2. Problem-Solving Prompt (DynamoDB Issues)
```
The AWS credentials provided don't have sufficient DynamoDB permissions (getting AccessDeniedException for DescribeTable and Scan operations). 

Switch to JSON file storage as fallback while maintaining the same API structure so it can easily be migrated back to DynamoDB later. The API layer should remain unchanged.

Keep all the same validation rules and business logic, just change the storage mechanism to a simple JSON file.
```

### 3. Bug Fixing Prompt (React Runtime Error)
```
Fix React runtime error in Add Monkey form: "Objects are not valid as a React child" error occurring when submitting the form. 

The error happens when handling API response/error objects in toast notifications. The testing agent identified this as a critical issue preventing form submission.

Ensure all error messages are properly converted to strings before rendering in React components. Also improve form reset functionality after successful submission.
```

## üèóÔ∏è Design & Trade-off Decisions

### 1. Storage Architecture Decision
**Decision**: JSON File Storage instead of DynamoDB
**Reasoning**: AWS credentials lacked necessary permissions (DescribeTable, Scan, etc.)
**Trade-offs**: 
- ‚úÖ Pro: Immediate functionality, no external dependencies
- ‚úÖ Pro: Easy to migrate to DynamoDB later (API unchanged)
- ‚ùå Con: Not suitable for high-scale production use
- ‚ùå Con: No built-in concurrent access handling

### 2. Frontend Framework Choice
**Decision**: React with Shadcn UI components
**Reasoning**: Modern, accessible, professional appearance
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Pro: Rich component library, excellent UX
- ‚úÖ Pro: Responsive design built-in
- ‚ùå Con: More complex than simple CLI
- ‚ùå Con: Longer development time

### 3. Validation Strategy
**Decision**: Dual-layer validation (Frontend + Backend)
**Reasoning**: Better UX with robust security
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Pro: Immediate user feedback + security
- ‚úÖ Pro: Graceful error handling
- ‚ùå Con: Code duplication
- ‚ùå Con: Maintenance overhead

### 4. API Design Pattern
**Decision**: RESTful API with proper HTTP status codes
**Reasoning**: Industry standard, easy to consume
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Pro: Predictable, well-understood patterns
- ‚úÖ Pro: Easy to document and test
- ‚ùå Con: More verbose than GraphQL
- ‚ùå Con: Multiple requests for complex operations

## üöß Blockers & Solutions

### Blocker 1: DynamoDB Permission Issues
**Problem**: AWS credentials lacked essential DynamoDB permissions
```
Error: AccessDeniedException - User not authorized to perform:
- dynamodb:DescribeTable
- dynamodb:Scan  
- dynamodb:PutItem (likely)
```
**Impact**: Backend completely non-functional, 500 errors on all endpoints
**Solution**: Pivoted to JSON file storage maintaining identical API structure
**Time Lost**: 20 minutes
**How Unblocked**: Strategic architectural decision to use alternative storage

### Blocker 2: React Runtime Error in Forms
**Problem**: "Objects are not valid as a React child" error crashed Add Monkey form
**Impact**: Users unable to create new monkeys, critical functionality broken
**Root Cause**: Error objects being rendered directly as React children in toast notifications
**Solution**: 
```javascript
// Before (broken)
description: error.response?.data?.detail || "Something went wrong!"

// After (fixed)  
description: typeof errorMessage === 'string' ? errorMessage : JSON.stringify(errorMessage)
```
**Time Lost**: 15 minutes
**How Unblocked**: Improved error handling with proper type checking

### Blocker 3: Shadcn SelectItem Validation Error
**Problem**: SelectItem component required non-empty string values
**Impact**: Species filter dropdown throwing console errors
**Root Cause**: Empty string value for "All Species" option
**Solution**:
```javascript
// Before (broken)
<SelectItem value="">All Species</SelectItem>

// After (fixed)
<SelectItem value="all">All Species</SelectItem>
```
**Time Lost**: 10 minutes
**How Unblocked**: Component API documentation review
